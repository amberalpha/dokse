*  Periods of strong price growth in London ripple out through the southeast towards lower priced areas in a cycle lasting 15-18 years, punctuated by a crash when everywhere is fully-priced.  We are late-cycle in 2021, approximately 3/4 done.

*  Within each area desirable high-priced districts first lead the price increases until they become unaffordable, at which point low-priced districts stage a catch-up.  Each area has it's own cycle and the magnitude is significant, especially late-cycle/new-cycle, i.e. now.

*  We provide is precise actionable metrics to track the cycle and its likely impact before the next reversal.  Insight into the cycle beats both trend-following and value investment.

*  It's normally kept quiet by the pros: new-build property is on average overpriced.  We show by how much without fear or favour so you can make an informed choice.
